# Portfolio
college project
Welcome to my Portfolio Website repository! This project was developed as part of my college coursework. It showcases my skills in web development using HTML and CSS.

Project Overview
This is a simple yet professional portfolio website designed to highlight my skills, projects, and achievements. The website is responsive and features various sections like an about me page, portfolio, and contact form. It is a static site created using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript or backend integration.

Features
Responsive Design: The website adjusts for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Navigation Bar: Easy-to-use navigation to move between sections of the site.
About Me Section: A brief introduction to who I am, my skills, and my interests.
Portfolio Section: Display of various projects I have worked on.
Contact Section: Placeholder for a contact form (can be extended to include backend functionality later).
Minimalistic and Clean Design: Focus on simplicity, making the content the main focus.
Tech Stack
HTML: Used to structure the content of the site.
CSS: Used to style the layout and design of the site.
